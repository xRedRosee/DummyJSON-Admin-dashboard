# DummyJSON admin dashboard

This is an admin dashboard website using an API to display data. I created this website for school, using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## What can you do on this website?

You can see data from users, carts, comments, posts and products from a webshop. I created a dashboard that shows all these data in cards with filter and search functions that can be found in the JS files. To display the data from the API I made use of the fetch function.

## What API did I use?
